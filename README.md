## Smart India Hackathon 2025 | Problem Statement SIH25099

**AI-powered monitoring of crop health, soil condition, and pest risks using multispectral/hyperspectral imaging and sensor data.**

**Organization:** MathWorks India Pvt. Ltd.

### Problem Statement Overview
Agriculture faces growing threats from soil degradation, unpredictable weather, and pest outbreaks, leading to reduced yields and economic losses. Traditional monitoring methods are often delayed, labor-intensive, and lack precision. There is a need for a unified software platform that integrates remote sensing and sensor data to provide timely, field-level insights on crop health, soil conditions, and pest risks using AI-driven analysis.

## Project Title: KrishiConnect – AI-Powered Crop Health & Risk Monitoring Platform

### Solution Overview
KrishiConnect is a unified software platform that leverages AI, remote sensing, and sensor data to deliver timely, field-level insights on crop health, soil conditions, and pest risks. It addresses the need for precision agriculture by automating diagnostics, contextual recommendations, and actionable alerts for farmers.

### Key Technologies & Tools Used
- Next.js (React): Modern web framework for building scalable, interactive dashboards.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS for rapid, responsive UI development.
- Recharts: Data visualization for crop yield, soil, and pest trends.
- Lucide-react: Icon library for intuitive UI.
- Genkit + Zod: AI orchestration and schema validation for robust data handling.
- Firebase (optional): For authentication and backend emulation.
- Nix: Dev environment management.
- Custom AI Flows: Modular agents for diagnosis, contextualization, onboarding, and voice assistant.

### Core Features
- **Comprehensive Dashboard:** A central hub showing weather, market prices, yield analytics, and quick actions.
- **AI-Powered Crop Health Analysis:** Uses multispectral/hyperspectral imaging and sensor data for real-time diagnostics.
- **Disease & Pest Identification:** Farmers upload plant images; AI identifies the plant, detects diseases/pests, and suggests organic/chemical treatment plans.
- **Weed Identification:** Identifies weeds from images and provides manual, organic, and chemical control methods.
- **AI Crop Advisor (Fasal Salahkaar):** Recommends profitable crops based on the farmer's location, soil type, budget, and farm size.
- **Smart Irrigation Schedule:** Generates a 7-day, weather-based watering plan to optimize water usage.
- **Environmental Contextualization:** Integrates weather, soil, and location data to improve prediction accuracy for pests and diseases.
- **Interactive Spectral Health Maps:** Visualizes crop health, soil summaries, and risk zones from drone/satellite imagery.
- **Pest & Disease Risk Prediction:** Forecasts pest/disease risks based on local weather forecasts.
- **AI Voice Assistant:** Natural language Q&A for crop health, weather, and recommended actions, with text-to-speech output.
- **Prompt-Assisted Initial Setup:** AI-powered onboarding to recommend data sources and configurations.

### How the Solution Works
1.  **Data Collection:** Farmers upload images (plants, soil, drone imagery) and provide details like location and crop type.
2.  **AI Analysis:** Custom Genkit AI flows process the data to perform specific tasks:
    *   `diagnostics`: Identifies the plant and any diseases or pests.
    *   `soil-analysis`: Analyzes soil health from an image.
    *   `crop-advisor`: Recommends suitable crops.
    *   `irrigation-schedule`: Creates a watering plan based on weather data.
    *   `pest-prediction`: Forecasts risks based on weather patterns.
3.  **Contextual Recommendations:** Environmental data (weather, soil) is used to refine predictions and suggest actionable solutions.
4.  **Visualization:** Results are displayed via an interactive dashboard with charts, reports, and generated spectral maps.
5.  **Alerts & Assistant:** Farmers receive timely notifications (feature proposed) and can interact with the AI voice assistant for guidance.

### Impact
- **Precision Agriculture:** Enables timely, accurate, and actionable insights for farmers.
- **Reduced Losses:** Early detection of risks minimizes yield loss and economic impact.
- **Scalability:** Modular architecture supports expansion to new crops, regions, and languages.
- **Farmer-Friendly:** Clean UI, intuitive navigation, and voice support ensure accessibility.
